# TypeScript Project:

## Description: 
  A web application for managing tasks, built with TypeScript, HTML, CSS. It includes features for adding/removing tasks, storing data in cookies, loading data from cookies to continue.

### Advantages: 
TypeScript provides static typing, enhancing code readability and catching errors at compile time. It offers excellent tooling support, including auto-completion and refactoring capabilities. TypeScript's compatibility with JavaScript libraries allows for easy integration of existing codebases.

### Disadvantages: 
Setting up TypeScript initially can be complex, especially for beginners. The type system might require additional effort for type annotations, which can increase development time.

# Prolog Project:

##  Description: 
  A finding prime numbers, implemented in Prolog. It uses logic programming to swiftly find if inputed number is prime by backtracking.

### Advantages: 
Prolog's declarative nature simplifies complex logic, making it suitable for rule-based systems like recommendation engines. It excels in handling symbolic computation and reasoning tasks, offering efficient pattern matching and backtracking capabilities.

### Disadvantages: 
Prolog's syntax can be unfamiliar to programmers accustomed to imperative or functional languages, leading to a steep learning curve. Debugging Prolog programs can be challenging due to its non-traditional execution model, where programs are evaluated through logical inference rather than step-by-step execution.
